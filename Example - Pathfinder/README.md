## Dijkstra's pathfinder algorithm

This Beads language sample program runs a simulation of Dijkstra's famous pathfinding algorithm.

You draw a wall with the mouse (right click to erase wall cells), and then you press ENTER and let the simulation run. You can also press SPACEBAR to go one step at a time.

This version was done naive HTML drawing, you can speed it up considerably by switching to canvas drawing.

This program was inspired by the Python version from codeNULL on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yUPeIayvfU&feature=youtu.be)
