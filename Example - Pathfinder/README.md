## Dijkstra's pathfinder algorithm

This Beads language sample program runs a simulation of Dijkstra's famous pathfinding algorithm.

You draw a wall with the mouse (right click to erase wall cells), and then you press ENTER and let the simulation run. You can also press SPACEBAR to go one step at a time.

This was done as an example to compare Python programs with Beads. They are close in length, but the Beads version has no external dependencies, and is a little nicer at resizing the screen.

This version was done naive HTML drawing, you can speed it up considerably by switching to canvas drawing.
