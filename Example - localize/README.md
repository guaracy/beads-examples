## Localization Utility

This is an example of how you can use the Beads language to quickly make useful web apps, desktop and mobile applications. This particualr product was intended to be a desktop app. It needs to be a desktop app because it does a lot of file manipulation on your local drive, reading in and merging string files, etc.

This is the handy graphical interactive localization utility for Beads, but could easily be adapted to some other source language, as it only needs to be able to parse enough of your source code to extract the strings that need translation.

 It allows you to visit Google translate to get your translation started, and lets you keep track of your translation progress, add new languages, etc.

Beads has a wonderful localization methodology, that people will find user friendly and convenient.
